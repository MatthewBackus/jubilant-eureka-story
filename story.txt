	It was a cool Friday evening in Wisconsin. There was a thin layer of snow draped over the city just outside. Inside, there was a UW student. This student thought
 he was done writing now that he just had computer science courses left to take, but little did he know that nothing is ever that simple. Just as he was about to submit his homework,
his computer started on fire. First he franticly tried blowing on it, but that didn't seem to stop the fire at all. If only there was a thin layer of snow draped over the city he could
use to put this fire out.
	Before the fire consumed the entire computer, he quickly ran outside with it and yeeted the whole thing into the snow. The snow was not very thick so it did not
immediately put out the fire. He began to make snowballs with what snow there was and pelted the computer with as many as he could. Finally, he managed to stuff out the fire.
Feeling good about his quick thinking he smiled to himself. Then the realization dawned on him: How would he submit his homework while his computer lie a ruined wreck on the grass?
	To make things worse, the computer was now soaked. "How could that have happened?" he thought.
